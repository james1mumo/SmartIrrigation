# Smart Home Irrigation system

## What is this?
it is a system to automate the watering of plants in your home
The system consists of a microcontroller (ESP32) that is connected to a water pump,
sensors to detect moisture levels in the soil, and a relay to turn the pump on and off.
The system can be controlled locally using push buttons, or remotely using a web interface
